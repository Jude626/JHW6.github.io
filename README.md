Created a Weather Dashboard that allows user to search for the 5-day forecast for the city of their choice using the OpenWeatherAPI Database. Allows the user to select previous searches as well on the left-hand side of the dashboard, saved on the local storage. The dashboard also shows the humidity, wind speed, & UV index as well!
